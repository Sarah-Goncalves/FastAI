# FastAI

Here you can find two notebooks made on Colab.    
They follow the lesson 1 and 2 of the FastAI Course that you can find [here](https://course.fast.ai/) explaned by Jeremy Howard.    
You'll see few codes adapted to Colab, since some codes used by Jeremy Howard are specific to Jupyter Notebook.
